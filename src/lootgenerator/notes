what i want here:
when the loot button is pressed i want the loot generated to be presented here...
need to add a function that allows for a given qty of loot to be generated...
maybe based on encounter level, or just a number of items, or a gp/currency amount of loot...
would like to be able to allow choice from different game settings; ie dnd, pathfinder, starfinder, d20 modern/future, etc, or just from all of them as one master list.
maybe add printer functionality...
definitely need save capabilities, save as txt file...
